# List Comprehension

# Notes:
    # - List Comprehension: making concise lists
    # - every output in this .py file is in a list
        # - list comprehensions can reduce for loops (and if conditions when added) to 1 line of code
            # - whatever the result, it will be outputted in a list, [ ... ]
    # - for loops can be written w/ 1 line of code
        # - structure: [ 'expression' '1st for loop line' ] *don't include quotations tho.
    # - if condition can be added in single line written for loops
        # - structure: [ 'expression' '1st for loop line' 'if' ] *don't include quotations tho. 

# iterating to double numbers from 1-10 inclusively

    num *= 2

print(original)
print(doubled)

print()

# same for loop as above but written w/ 1 line of code

# iterate triple the numbers via single for loop
tripled = [ number * 3 for number in range(1, 11) ]

print(" --- new --- ")


# iterate the square of numbers via single for loop
squared = [ number **2 for number in range(1, 11) ]

# iterate over strings via single for loop

# the 'num' before the for loop means it's being returned (like what the return statement does)

# put all -ve numbers in new list
negative_nums = [ num for num in all_numbers if num < 0 ]
