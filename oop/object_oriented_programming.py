# Object Oriented Programming

# Notes:

# objects:
# - these are a bundle of related attributes & methods
#   - e.g. car, person, book, mobile, etc. (any 'noun' thing really)

# attributes:
# - these are similar to variables
# - they describe what object has

# methods:
# - they are functions inside the object
# - these functions belong to the object

# classes:
# - they are used to make many objects
# - they are a type of blueprint used to design layout & structure of an object
# - they are used to design the attributes & methods of an object
#   - what do the objects have (attributes) and what do the objects do (methods)
