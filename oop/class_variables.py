# Class Variables

# Notes:

# - class variables are variables shared among all instances/objects made from the same class

# instance variables:
    # - these are defined INSIDE a constructor
    # - each object has their own of these variables

# class variables:
    # - these are defined OUTSIDE a constructor
    # - these can share their data with all objects made from the same class
