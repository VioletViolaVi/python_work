# Exceptions

# Notes

# exceptions are events that interrupt regular flow of programs
# some types of exceptions include (there's a lot more ðŸ“œ):
    #   - ArithmeticError
    #   - IndentationError
    #   - ValueError
    #   - ZeroDivisionError
    #   - AttributeError
    #   - etc.
# try/except/finally blocks are created to handle exception errors
    #   - 'try' portions run when code doesn't produce an error
    #   - 'except' portions run when code causes an error
    #   - 'finally' portions always run regardless of whether the 'try' or 'except' portions ran
