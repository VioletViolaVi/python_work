# Super Function - super()

# Notes:

# child class == subclass
# parent class == superclass

# best practice to write constructor code once then reuse it by allowing other classes to inherit attributes from it
    # - super() helps achieve this

# super()
    # - it's a function
    # - used in child classes
    # - calls attributes/methods from parent class into child classes
    # - extends functionality of inherited methods
        # - e.g. putting 'super()' in a (grand) child class's method

# extending functionality
    # - 'super()' is used to extend functionality from parent class to the child class
        # - e.g., parent class has 'def eats(self)...', child class has 'def eats(self)...'
            # - put 'super()' in child's 'def eats(self)...' method

# method overriding
    # - if a child class inherits a method from the parent class, whilst holding a method with the same name in its own class, the child's method will be outputted and override the parent's method
        # - e.g., parent class has 'def describe(self)...', child class has 'def describe(self)...'
            # - the 'def describe(self)...' in the child class will be outputted 
                # - NOT the one in the parent class
