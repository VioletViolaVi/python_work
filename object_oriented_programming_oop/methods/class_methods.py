# Class Methods

# Notes:

# class methods use 'cls' as their keyword parameter in their brackets
    # - e.g. def class_method(cls)...
        # - similar to how instance methods use 'self'


# a simple class
class Student:

    # class variable
    student_counter = 0

    # constructor
    def __init__(self, name, exam_title, percentage_score):
        self.name = name
        self.exam_title = exam_title
        self.percentage_score = percentage_score
        Student.student_counter += 1

    # simple instance method
        # - 'self' is used in brackets
    def student_bio(self):
        
        # string has been formatted to make text appear clearer to read
        return f"Name: {self.name:<10} Exam Title: {self.exam_title:<10} Percentage Score (%): {self.percentage_score:<10}"
    
    # class method
        # - 'cls' is used in brackets
    # '@classmethod' decorator to be added whenever a class method is to be made
    @classmethod
    def student_total(cls):
        return f"Total number of students so far: {Student.student_counter}"
