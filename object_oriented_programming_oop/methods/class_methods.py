# Class Methods

# Notes:

# class methods use 'cls' as their keyword parameter in their brackets
    # - e.g. def class_method(cls)...
        # - similar to how instance methods use 'self'


# a simple class
class Student:

    # class variables
    student_counter = 0
    total_percentage_score = 0
    average_percentage_score = 0

        Student.student_counter += 1
        Student.total_percentage_score += percentage_score
        # average -> addition of all numbers then divide by number of numbers
        # calculates average percentage score of all students
        Student.average_percentage_score = Student.total_percentage_score / Student.student_counter

        # - 'self' is used in brackets

    # class method
        # - 'cls' is used in brackets
            # - 'cls' means class
    # '@classmethod' decorator to be added whenever a class method is to be made
    # this '@classmethod' is used to get the value of the class variable & use it in the f string
