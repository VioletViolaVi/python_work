# Magic Methods

# Notes:

# magic methods aka dunder methods
# these are are methods that start & end with double underscores
    # - e.g. '__init__' like the ones used in constructor previously
# usually used inside classes
# these methods are automatically called by python's built in operations e.g. 'print()' function, '==' operator, '>=' operator, '<' operator, etc.
    # when python operators are used on object, it becomes possible to customise the behaviour of said object 


# standard class
class Song:
    
    # this constructor is a 'magic method' aka 'dunder method'
        # double underscores before & after 'init' makes it a magic/dunder method
    def __init__(self, title, genre, recording_artist, sales):
        self.title = title
        self.genre = genre
        self.recording_artist = recording_artist
        self.sales = sales

    # a different type of magic/dunder method
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Song name: {self.title} | Music genre: {self.genre} | Artist/Band: {self.recording_artist} | Number of sales: {self.sales:,}"
