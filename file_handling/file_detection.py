# File Detection

# Notes

# os module needs to be imported to give python a way to interact with the operating system
    #   - os means 'operating system'
# relative file path
    #   - this path states how to get to the file from your current directory (the file location you are currently working from e.g. THIS '.py' file)
# absolute file path 
    #   - this states how to access the file from the root of the file system

# need to import to be able to detect files
import os

# variable contains string that matches the real file path of the 'test_file.txt' file
file_path = ""
