# to create a file
# features of code below:
    # 'with' is a statement used to wrap blocks of code for execution
    # 'with' statement will close file once code is done using it
        # - prevents need to manually close files
        # - important to close files once done w/ them being opened to avoid unexpected behaviours occurring
            # - it's good practice
    # 'open()' function returns file object
        # -  1st parameter/placeholder in 'open()' function is for the file path (file)
        # -  2nd parameter/placeholder in 'open()' function is the mode
            #   types of modes:
                #   - 'w' means write
                    #   - will create new file from scratch
                    #   - can also overwrite same file
                #   - 'x' means also means write but will only do so if the file doesn't exist already otherwise an error will be thrown (FileExistsError)
                #   - 'a' means to append file
                #   - 'r' means read
    # 'as' keyword is used to give with statement a name to be know as within the code
        # - example below means file object output given out by the 'with' statement will be called 'file'
