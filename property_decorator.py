# Property Decorator

# Notes:

# @property decorator enables the ability to define a method as a property
# @property decorator makes respective part of code able to be accessed/treated as if it's an attribute
    #   - e.g. when @property method is created, the name of the method can be called w/out its brackets
        #   - 'human.weight' instead of 'human.weight()' (see print statements below)
# additional logic can be added using the @property decorator
    #   - additional logic can be added when reading, writing & deleting attributes
# @property methods provides the following when working w/ attributes:
    #   - getter method -> to read
    #   - setter method -> to write
    #   - deleter method -> to delete


# standard class
class Human:

    # standard constructor/magic/dunder method
    def __init__(self, name, age, weight, height):

        # '_' need to be added to attribute variable names otherwise AttributeError will throw
            #   - e.g.: AttributeError: property 'age' of 'Human' object has no setter
        # adding the '_' tells you & other developers reading this code that the attributes are to be protected/private
            # - these '_' attributes should not be used/accessed outside the class
            # - the '_' attributes are internal
            # - getter methods are used instead to get these attributes to use their values
