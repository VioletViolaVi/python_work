# Sets

# Notes:
    # - sets 'print() out' differently each time '@ random'
    # - sets cannot be edited (add/remove/reassign items) 
    # - sets are unordered (probs 'cause/why they print out differently)
    # - sets cannot have more than 1 of the same item (lists can)
        # - {"eggs", "eggs", "bacon", "beans"} would NOT be allowed
        # - .count() for counting multiple of the same item in a set would probs not be useful

weathers = {"sunny", "rainy", "clear", "snowy", "icy", "dry", "wet"}
print(weathers)
