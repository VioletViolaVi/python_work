# Cinema Snack Kiosk / Snack Bar

# Notes:
    # - users select food they want & get told total price
    # - unique_list = list(set(basket))*
        #  - *can work as just a set i.e. set(basket)
        #  - *list() still good to wrap set(), in case user wants a duplicate receipt, snacks would print same order
