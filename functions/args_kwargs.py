# Arguments (*args) and Keyword Arguments (**kwargs)

# Notes
    # - *args and **kwargs are used when you don't know how many arguments will be passed when function is called
    # - 'args' and 'kwargs' don't have to be used but they are convention among developers
        # - '*' and '**' are what's important to add in 'def python_func()' brackets
            # - e.g. *test, **test_dict, *example, **example_dict, etc.
