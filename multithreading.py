# Multithreading

# Notes
# - multithreading is used to perform multiple tasks at the same time (think of this as multitasking)
# - multithreading is good for input output tasks
    # - examples included reading files, fetching data from APIs
        # - any activity that will take time to do & it is unknown when these activities will be completed
# - the 'threading' module is to be imported to carry out multithreading
