# Decorator

# Notes:

# decorator is a function that extends the behaviour of another function 
# decorators don't make changes to the original base function they are added to 
# base functions are passed through decorator function as an argument/value


# creating a decorator
# use this format for creating decorators
# pass through base function in brackets '(...)' as the argument/value
def add_sugar(func_param):

    # inner function required to stop decorator from outputting contents of base function, w/out the base function making the call
    def layer():

        # function being passed through as the argument/value gets called inside inner function
        func_param()
    
    # returns entire function
    # 'layer' NOT 'layer()' as TypeError occurs
        #   - TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable
    return layer

# decorator added on code line above base function
@add_sugar
