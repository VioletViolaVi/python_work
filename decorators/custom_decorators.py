# Decorators (self made decorators)

# Notes:

# decorator is a function that extends the behaviour of another function 
# decorators don't make changes to the original base function they are added to 
# base functions are passed through decorator function as an argument/value


# creating a decorator
# use this format for creating decorators
# pass through base function in brackets '(...)' as the argument/value
def add_sugar(func_param):

    # inner function required to stop decorator from outputting contents of base function, w/out the base function making the call
        #   -  the '@add_sugar' decorator will cause print statements to be outputted in terminal despite 'bake_cake()' not being called
    # *args & **kwargs used to allow for any number of values to be passed through this function, when called
    # this is where parameters are placed if base function is called whilst passing value(s) through
    def layer(*args, **kwargs):

        # function being passed through as the argument/value gets called inside inner function
        print()
